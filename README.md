Client Server Tic Tac Toe

This project allows people for playing of tic tac toe on two different devices on the command line. The server gets connected to by the client and creates a board. Both players take turns playing, the client sends its moves to the server and then receives an updated board back. After each move the server checks if the game is over or if their is a tie. 

I built this becuase I wanted to get better at socket programming with Java. I've built far more complicated client-server programs in Java before, this was mainly a refresher/warm-up. What I first wanted to do was a client server chess game with a GUI and everything. But I decided to do this first and see if doing something in the same scope but far more compliacted would be fun. I did enjoy this and was able to write it quickly, so I may build a chess game next.  

To run this program use two devices. The device running the client side needs the IP address of the device running the server side. Once the server side is up and running the client can respond to the IP address prompt. Players are prompted for moves.
